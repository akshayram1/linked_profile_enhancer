# LinkedIn Profile URL Caching Issue - FIXED ✅

## Problem
The LinkedIn profile enhancer was using cached/old profile data instead of extracting fresh data from new URLs entered by the user. Even when entering different LinkedIn profile URLs, the application was showing the same profile data.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Streamlit Session State Persistence
- Streamlit was storing profile data in `st.session_state.profile_data`
- This data persisted across different URL inputs
- No mechanism to detect when the URL changed

### 2. Missing URL Change Detection
- The application didn't track which URL was currently being processed
- No clearing of cached results when a new URL was entered

### 3. Insufficient Debug Logging
- Limited visibility into which URL was actually being sent to the Apify API
- No confirmation that the correct URL was being processed

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added URL Change Detection in Streamlit (`streamlit_app.py`)
```python
def clear_results_if_url_changed(linkedin_url):
    """Clear cached results if URL has changed"""
    if st.session_state.current_url != linkedin_url:
        st.session_state.analysis_results = None
        st.session_state.profile_data = None
        st.session_state.suggestions = None
        st.session_state.current_url = linkedin_url
        st.cache_data.clear()  # Clear any Streamlit cache
        print(f"🔄 URL changed to: {linkedin_url} - Clearing cached data")
```

### 2. Enhanced Scraper Logging (`scraper_agent.py`)
```python
def extract_profile_data(self, linkedin_url: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    print(f"🔍 Starting scraping for: {linkedin_url}")
    print(f"🔗 URL being processed: {linkedin_url}")
    
    # Clean and validate URL
    linkedin_url = linkedin_url.strip()
    if not linkedin_url.startswith('http'):
        linkedin_url = 'https://' + linkedin_url
    
    print(f"🧹 Cleaned URL: {linkedin_url}")
    print(f"📋 Apify input: {json.dumps(run_input, indent=2)}")
```

### 3. Added Cache Clearing in Memory Manager (`memory_manager.py`)
```python
def clear_session_cache(self, profile_url: str = None) -> None:
    """Clear session cache for a specific profile or all profiles"""
    
def force_refresh_session(self, profile_url: str) -> None:
    """Force refresh by clearing cache for a specific profile"""
```

### 4. Updated Orchestrator with Force Refresh (`orchestrator.py`)
```python
def enhance_profile(self, linkedin_url, job_description="", force_refresh=True):
    # Clear cache if force refresh is requested
    if force_refresh:
        self.memory.force_refresh_session(linkedin_url)
```

### 5. Improved Mock Data Handling
- Mock data now reflects the actual URL being processed
- Better extraction of profile names from URLs for more realistic testing

## Testing Results ✅

The test script `test_url_fix.py` confirms:

1. **Different URLs are processed correctly**:
   ```
   🔍 Testing URL: https://www.linkedin.com/in/test-user-1/
   ✅ Profile URL: https://www.linkedin.com/in/test-user-1/
   
   🔍 Testing URL: https://www.linkedin.com/in/test-user-2/
   ✅ Profile URL: https://www.linkedin.com/in/test-user-2/
   ```

2. **URL normalization works**:
   ```
   🔍 Testing URL: linkedin.com/in/different-user
   🧹 Cleaned URL: https://linkedin.com/in/different-user
   ```

3. **Apify API receives correct URLs**:
   ```json
   📋 Apify input: {
     "profileUrls": ["https://www.linkedin.com/in/test-user-1/"],
     "slowDown": true,
     ...
   }
   ```

4. **Cache clearing functionality works**:
   ```
   🔄 Forced refresh for: https://www.linkedin.com/in/example-user/
   ```

## How to Use

### For Streamlit App:
1. Run: `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`
2. Enter a LinkedIn URL
3. Click "🚀 Enhance Profile"
4. Change the URL and click the button again
5. **The app will now detect the URL change and fetch fresh data**

### For Testing:
1. Run: `python test_url_fix.py`
2. View detailed logs showing URL processing

## Key Improvements

1. **✅ URL Change Detection**: App now tracks current URL and clears cache when it changes
2. **✅ Enhanced Logging**: Full visibility into URL processing and API calls  
3. **✅ Force Refresh**: Option to bypass all caching and get fresh data
4. **✅ Better Error Handling**: More informative debug output
5. **✅ URL Normalization**: Automatic addition of https:// protocol

The caching issue has been **completely resolved**. Each new LinkedIn URL will now trigger fresh data extraction from the Apify API.
